## üß† How to Read This Repository

### 1. Problem-Solving Approach
- Some source files contain **multiple solutions**.
- Solutions are usually ordered from:
  - **Less efficient** ‚Üí **More optimized**
  - **Easier logic** ‚Üí **More complex approach**

### 2. Code Comments You‚Äôll See
To help you understand the logic behind each solution, comments in the code use these tags:

| Tag          | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `intuition`  | The core idea or strategy behind the solution.                          |
| `pseudo code`| more detailed version of the approach for more complex algorithms.       |
| `motivation` | The key "trick", math principle, or insight that makes the solution work.|

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Java-specific quirks or features are also explained in comments when needed.

### 3. Problem Naming Convention

Each source file is named in this format:

```
<Article or Bonus Number>_<Problem Name>_<LeetCode Problem Number>
```

#### Examples:
- `A5_MissingNumber_268`  
  ‚Üí Article problem #5, search in leetcode problem number 268, verify its name is "Missing Number"
- `B4_SumOfUniqeElement_1748`  
  ‚Üí Bonus problem #4, search in leetcode problem number 1748, verify its name is "Sum Of Uniqe Element"
