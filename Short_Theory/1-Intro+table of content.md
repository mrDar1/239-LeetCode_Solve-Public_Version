1. here found 239 problems and solutions, at Data Structure and algorithms.
when have several solutions in same source code file, the order is:
less efficence first to more optimize solutions later, or easier approach to harder.
all solve at Java.
Java have several uniqeness - whenever it happens - can read about it in comments.

2. my code comments inside source files:
"intuition" - usually solution come with general idea of code.
"pseudo code" - whenever its more complicated concept and regular "intuition" not enoughe - its not regular full pseudo coude but more detailed than "intuition".
"motivation" - last and most important, although not very common, its the "trick" or the math principle the algorithm work on.

3. structure of naming problems:
<Article/Bonus number> , <name> , <number of problem at leetcode website >

example:
A5_MissingNumber_268		---- "A5=article problem #5, search in leetcode problem number 268, verify its name is "Missing Number"
B4_SumOfUniqeElement_1748   ---- "B4=Bonus   problem #4, search in leetcode problem number 1748, verify its name is "Sum Of Uniqe Element"
