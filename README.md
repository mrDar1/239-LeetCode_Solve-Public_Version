## here one found 239 problems and solutions - at Data Structure and algorithms.
all of them at java language.
most have several solutions.

architecture: each source file is a single problem at leetcode, that can run by its own. no file here depend on other file at the project.
if have several solutions on same file: at the top will have the less efficient solutions and next the more optimized solutions.


recommend first read short theory and then start exercise the chapter.
recommend doing chapters 1 by 1 theory + exercise, only after continue to next one.
