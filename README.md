## Here one found 239 problems and solutions - in Data Structures and Algorithms.

All of them are in Java language.  
Most have several solutions.

**Architecture**: Each source file is a single problem from Leetcode that can run on its own.  
Each file is standalone (==No file here depends on other files in the project.)  
If a file has several solutions, the top part has the less efficient ones, and below are the more optimized solutions.

**Recommendation:**  
First, read the "Short_Theory", then start practicing the chapter.  
Do the chapters one by one â€” theory+exercises, theory+exercises â€” only then move to the next chapter.  
**at each problem, firs open leetcode website and read problem description before watch solution**
